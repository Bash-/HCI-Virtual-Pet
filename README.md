# HCI-Virtual-Pet

### An app created for children
Virtual Pet is a project for the university of Twente. A lot of children want a dog or another pet at a certain age, however, mostly the parents are not in to that. Because of this we are creating an app that makes these children aware of the responsibilities that come along with a pet, in this case a dog. 
The idea is that kids need to do actions that are as real as possible, but with a virtual dog. To walk with the dog they really need to go outside and walk a certain distance. They also need to go to the grocery store when there is no food left for the dog.
